\section{Concept}
\label{sec:concept}

As mentioned in \ref{sec:intro}, data produced by sensors on wearables needs to be transferred to mobile devices in order to be processed.
All Android Wear devices are connected via Bluetooth, we will use this connection to exhange the data with the mobile device.

\subsection{Apps}
We need an app on every device that we want to use.

\subsubsection{Wearable App}
To access the sensor data, an app needs to be deployed on the wearable device. It is responsible of:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item asdf
	\item asdfasdf
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Mobile App}
