\subsection{Benchmarks}
\label{sec:evaluation:benchmarks}
In order to measure how performant different implementations are, we created different benchmarks.
These helped us to evaluate which parts of our solution require optimization.

\subsubsection{Data Transmission Delay}
When transmitting data, we had to


In order to reduce the serialization overhead, we collected sensor data in DataBatches|\cite{sensordatalogger:databatch} before transferring it to a mobile device.
This approach drastically improves the \textit{delay per sent byte} ratio, because we have to serialize and deserialize less messages and less meta data.
However, it also delays the data depending on the batch capacity.
Just like buffering a stream, this is a trade-off between beeing less efficient or beeing less real-time.
