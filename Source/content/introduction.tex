\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

When speaking about mobile devices and wearables, it might not be exactly clear which kind of hardware I'm talking about.

Mobile devices are smartphones or tablets in this context. Most of the currently available mobile devices offer capabilities that could only be expected from desktop PCs a few years ago.

Wearables can be described as technology gadgets that you can wear on your body, e.g. around your wrist.
Usually they are loaded with sensors and can be connected to an other mobile device via Bluetooth.
The most commonly used wearables are smartwatches and fitness trackers, but the technology can also live in clothing or jewellery.


\subsection{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Why we need to access sensor data
		\begin{itemize}
			\item activity feedback
			\item event triggers
			\item games
		\end{itemize}
	\item Why we can't process the data on wearables
		\begin{itemize}
			\item battery consumption
			\item lack of processing power
			\item different context
		\end{itemize}
	\item Why we need them in real time
