\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

To achieve our project goal of a seamless authentication using nothing but the sensors from a user's devices, we need to transfer huge amounts of data every second.
Our solution provides a performant jet battery friendly way of exchanging messages with data payloads between wearables and mobile devices.
It allowed us to develop a product that fulfilled all our project requirements.

We also implemented our solution in an open source app\footnote{\href{https://github.com/Steppschuh/Sensor-Data-Logger}{https://github.com/Steppschuh/Sensor-Data-Logger}} that is available for free through the Google Play Store\footnote{\href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.steppschuh.sensordatalogger}{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.steppschuh.sensordatalogger}}.
It is capable of visualizing sensor data from the current mobile or a connected wearable device in real-time.
This app can be used as a reference for related research and for demonstration purposes.
